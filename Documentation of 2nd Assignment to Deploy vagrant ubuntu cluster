Explanation for the Script:

A script that helps install a master and slave Ubuntu vagrant machine.
And also runs LAMP stack


Must have:

-vagrant
-virtual box

(This must be present in the machine that is running this script)



slave & master:
	memory: 1024
	cpus: 2
	
	

Slave machine:

name = slave_1
image = ubuntu/focal64
network:
	private_network
	constant ip: "192.168.20.11" (change_this to what that can be used on your bare metal)
	
Slave configuration:
	update & upgrade machine
	
	install:
		- sshpass: for bypassing the password while logging in
		- switching the passowrd authenticator on to log in using password
		- restarting the sshd service
		- installing avahi-daemon libnss-mdns
		
Master machine

name = master
image = ubuntu/focal64
network:
	private_network
	constant ip: "192.168.20.10" (change_this to what that can be used on your bare metal)


Master configuration:
	update & upgrade machine
	
	install:
		- sshpass: for bypassing the password while logging in
		- switching the passowrd authenticator on to log in using password
		- restarting the sshd service
		- installing avahi-daemon libnss-mdns
		
		
script configuration:
- creating a sudo user named "altschool"
- creating ssh key for the user "altschool"
- copy the user "altschool" ssh to the slave machine (only the user altschool should be able to ssh into the slave machine with a password)
- copy a file named "/mnt" from the "altschool" user to the slave machine.
		
		

LAMP stack (slave & master installation):
	LAMP: (linux, apache, mysql & php):
	- Installing MySQL
	- Installing Apache2 Web Server
	- Installing PHP & Requirements
	- Enabling Modules
	- Restarting Apache
	
	
	
Finally, from the script a LAMP stack will be installed on both master and slave as soon as the script executes. 
A restart will take effect for the apache server after the installation and configuration.
Different versions of php will be installed because some servers require more recent versions of PHP.
Also MySQL server and client are going to be installed on both Master and Slave.
